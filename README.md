# Finding
1.	50% of total revenue is generated from a 13% customer base: A small segment of customers is responsible for a substantial portion of our income
2. One of our key customers (ID: MEREP) has abruptly ceased placing orders.
3.	50% of total orders are less than 1k but accounted for only 16% of revenue. Large orders above 3k : 11% orders accounted for 40% of the revenue
4. 3 out of the top 10 products were decided not to continue which will have a significant negative impact on revenue as well as relationships with customers who have a high purchased volume of them
5.	 Customers who have more numbers of products tend to buy more in total
6. Top customers are most interested in the top products. 
7. Many products have stock levels lower than the minimum quantity required: causing potential loss of sale due to understock, especially for the top-selling. At the same time, many are overstocked, causing storage costs, loss due to expired stock, and cash flow issuesâ€¦
8. The current reorder point (ROP) set by the company is not a good indicator of managing stock level: too high, too low, at 0
9. 9 of of 10 top products (check next slide) with ROP at 0 (meaning only reorder when they are run out of stock): very risky
# Recommendations
## Immediate actions to implement
1.	Restock best-selling items currently out of stock or low in inventory to avoid sales loss
2.	Reactivate key product IDs 29, 17, and 28, previously in the top 10, to the product lineup.
3.	Investigate why MEREP ceased orders and restore the relationship
4.	Examine customers previously ranked #6 to #10 to identify reasons for their decreased rankings.
5.	Update Inventory Strategies: Establish a new reorder point (ROP) system for improved inventory management.
6.	Clear Overstock: Launch a stock clearance promotion to manage overstocked items efficiently.
 
## Strategic recommendation
1.	Focusing intensively on the top customers  with loyalty programs, contracting, personalized account manager
2.	At the same time engaging and developing relationships with the remaining customers to encourage them to order more 
3.	Separating shipping cost from product pricing to make them appear more competitive and to be more flexible with the different offerings to different customers/products
4.	Offering free shipping with the condition of Minimum order value to encourage larger order
5.	Introducing a minimum order threshold of 200$ gradually and flexibly to different groups of customers
6.	Regularly communicate with customers through newsletters or updates on new products and offers to keep them engaged
7.	Expanding market, acquiring new customers
